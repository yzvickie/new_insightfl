I like it a lot. It shows that you relaly put a ton of time in this and you understand all the aspects of coding relaly well which is something i envy! i relaly like how you made direct links to the sites that were included in the portfolio. I would have rather seen a little more hiarchy with the menu pages. It took me a while to figure out where they were and it was getting frustrating. Maybe just changing the size or adding more space between each menu title to differentiate it from the text? other then that it looks great! good job","date":"Tuesday, June 18th, 2013"},{"title":"qjkFsAlkypzy","body":"Presentation:  I like the corlos used (obviously, as I used them in mine too!! lol) and feel that with the corlos and the background texture it looks royal.  The background texture looks like a leather bound book.  I like that the look of the site is very consistent on each page, and that she chose to have the  Your business can have a fully-functional .  tagline on each of the pages.  That keeps it in the eye of the potential client.Usability:  The navigation is very clear   the menu is directly at the top of the page.  One thing is maybe the navigation can be added to the footer as well so that when you are scrolling on the longer pages on a smaller screen, you won't have to go back up to the top of the page to move around.  Also, another idea is that maybe the navigation could have been put in the banner at the side to bring that more into the overall design. Organization:  Clear organization.  Each page is concise.","date":"Tuesday, June 18th, 2013"},{"title":"test 1","body":"akdjflkjs\r\nasdfkjsdf\r\nsdf\r\nsadf","date":"Thursday, May 9th, 2013"},{"title":"Test from jl","body":"Gfnnhgdnhgdnhg\r\nHg jogging\r\nNfdhgfdbgfdgffgfhgfdhfd.

Chapters 6 and 7 seem to all be about robots and emotions. I didn't really want to read about robots having emotions since it didn't have much to do with emotional design in terms of products outside of the robots realm. Say what? Yeah I decided not to read the rest of the book because it's about robots. Sorry Stephanie, I know you like robots. Maybe you would be interested in reading the book. Chapters 6 and 7 are about robots. I did decide to [...]","date":"Tuesday, April 2nd, 2013"},{"title":"Emotional Design Part II Ch 3 & 4","body":"Instead of writing an outline similar to what I did for the first part of the book, I'm going to mention the key points that I liked about this book.

As it turns out, Commentator Comments had a bug that didn't allow users to type the < symbol in <3. When that symbol was typed, the comment is truncated at the < symbol, since you can't have an open < without an end tag > in HTML. I found out the strip_tags function was used and it didn't allow for it. I had to create two special cases to include <3 and :< as allowable symbols. But that's not very reliable, since what if someone types something that [...]","date":"Tuesday, April 1st, 2013"},{"title":"Emotional Design by Donald A.

I've been reading it for quite a while now, but have not gotten past the first chapter after reading the prologue every time I pick up the book. This time, I am documenting what I read in short summaries as I read in the hopes that it will motivate me to keep going.
