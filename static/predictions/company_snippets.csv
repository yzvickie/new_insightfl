325,GoGoHealth,111508,5,A new way to deliver health,"At GoGoHealth, we’re creating on-demand, asynchronous health care delivery over the Internet.

Half of visits to primary doctor’s offices are for 40 common illnesses and conditions, such as shingles, pinkeye or infected ear.

These illnesses are not hard to diagnose or treat, but most people have to take time out of their day to see their caregivers. Many just skip going to their doctors, allowing these small illnesses to progress and sometimes become more serious and painful.

GoGoHealth has developed a platform that allows for safe, secure, and quick relief for these ailments.

Doctors determine how to treat illnesses, then dispense advice, a prescription, or -- if needed -- a request for an in-person examination.

The value to patients is clear: They get quick relief, get it from their own doctors wherever they are, and won’t skip seeking treatment.

The value to doctors is greater: They “see” more patients, don’t waste time on minor cases, and keep their patients happy and loyal."

At Hundo we are passionate about solving a real world problem that we all face multiple times per day, ""What should I get/do? Is this good? Will it last?""

When it comes to product reviews only two things matter:
1) Convenience - is it easy find?
2) Context - whose opinion is this? can I trust it?

The problem with Yelp and the like is that they confuse context for quantity, and convenience for features and length. If every review was easy to find, straight to the point, and came from a reliable source, there would be no need for 100+ reviews. Not only is one enough but it's actually better!

So, if you've ever asked a friend for a recommendation; from what movie to see, to the best thing on the menu - that is what Hundo is for. We are turning product reviews into social objects, making them searchable on the web and instantly accessible from your phone.

Apartment markets are often misunderstood because of the private nature of rental transactions. This leads to a huge data problem where stakeholders spend countless hours trying to piece together market movements.

Solution

We have built a platform that automatically aggregates the noisy market data that signals apartment market movements. We make sense of this data by applying pricing algorithms that predict rental prices based on an apartment's location and attributes.
